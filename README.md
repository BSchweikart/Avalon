# Avalon
This is a MUD-style game being devloped by students from the CSC-253 night class. We are using DnD as the base allowing players to move
through out the world. The player will be able to progress becoming stronger as they dive deeper into the levels. Players will be able to 
view their items, along with managment of said items. The player will be able to interact with NPC's on a limited scale.
